      <description>This is the Rankine Chronicles. The Rankine Chronicles is the blog of Ali Rankine. By day, I am the Architect of the software systems at a major high-street fashion brand, where i wrestle with requirements and play around with programs. At night, I stick with the code and build stuff for fun. I have just started to write the first posts here, and i&amp;rsquo;m not sure how it will go, or even what it will end up looking like, but for now, this will do.</description>
